Our model can predict whether a tweet is neutral with 90% accuracy. 
The only input our model requires is tweets, the tweets goes through a filtering and cleaning process 
where all the words are broken down and put into a standard formatting such as lowercasing, lemmatizing, 
removing of punctuations/etc.
From there, we are able to find out the importance of each word throughout every tweet 
and because the model has already predicted if the tweet is neutral; 
we can tokenize and collect all the words associated with tweets predicted to be negative or positive.
